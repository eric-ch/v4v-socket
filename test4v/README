test4v is a collection of tests for the v4v kernel module from userland.

Test binaries may share usual headers in common/include to avoid code
duplication and ease test writing.

sockops will ease testing usual socket behaviour through cli interface. It
provides a trivial logic to add commands in order to test standard socket
operations.

Usage: sockops <command> [...]
Commands:
help    Display help.
socket  <stream|dgram>  Create a V4V socket of given type.
bind    <addr> <port>   Create a V4V stream socket and binds the given address.
listen  <addr> <port>   Create a V4V stream socket, binds the given address and set it listening.
